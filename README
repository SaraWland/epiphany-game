Epiphany is a GPL'ed (free software) multi-platform clone of BoulderDash.
The player must collect all valuable minerals scattered in levels,
avoiding being hit by a falling boulder, or (worst :) by a bomb.


Current version: 0.9.0
Tested under Linux and Win32, on x86_64 systems;

It is an alpha version, but it is playable.
It uses SDL2 and SDL2_mixer (http://www.libsdl.org), so make sure they are properly 
installed before compiling Epiphany.
